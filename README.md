# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Library Used

I have used Material UI library to reuse some of the components instead of styling is specifically.
And have used React-router-dom for navigation

## Things to improve on
Use jest or mocha for unit test cases
Use a redux store and set API response there
Implment pagination or infinite scroll for huge response
Keep lev nav and header with user details.
